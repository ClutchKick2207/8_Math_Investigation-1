## Definitions/Knowledge:

### ISO:

The ISO is the sensor at the camera body. The sensitivity is directly proportional to the amount of light in an image (i.e. **Doubling the ISO doubles the image brightness**)

* The higher the ISO **The brighter the image** (is also directly proportional)
* The higher the ISO **The noisier the image** (as the sensor is more sensitive to light, not more light entering)

### Shutter Speed:

The Shutter speed is the amount of time that the ISO can have light for. Shutter Speed is directly proportional to the amount of light in an image (i.e. **Doubling the Shutter Speed doubles the image brightness**)

* The higher the Shutter Speed **The brighter the image** (is also directly proportional)
* The higher the Shutter Speed **More motion blur is visible** (as the shutter is open for longer, it can take photos while the subject has moved, making it blurred)

### Aperature:

Controls the amount of light that the sensor recieves. (**Note that the larger the f-stop number, the smaller the aperature**). Aperature is inversely proportional to the amount of light in an image (i.e. **Decreasing the f-stop by a factor of &radic;2&asymp;1.4 will double the brightness in the image.**)

* The higher the Aperature the dimmer the image (is inversely proportional)
* The lower the Aperature
